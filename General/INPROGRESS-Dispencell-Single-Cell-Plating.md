Dispencell Sample Prep
================================================================================
Description: Dispencell allows for a single cell to be place in a well at at time, which can be used to create monoclonal, genetically identical cell lines. The cells must be diluted to a working concentration, then filtered to be loaded onto the Molecular Devices Dispencell

[Go To Protocol](#protocol)


Materials:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * Plate of confluent cells <br/>
    ◦ If this cell type has not been plated for monoclones before, perform a dilution series and track the cell line's ability to grow from a single cell.
  * PBS
  * 20 µM filter [Provided]
  * DispensMe tube containing methylcellulose [Provided]
<!-- Using distinct bullet symbols with 2 spaces at end of each line makes a better formatted list -->


Equipment Required:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * Microcentrifuge
  * Denovix CellDrop Cell Counter
  * Molecular Devices Dispencell S2
  * Incucyte (Whole Well imaging)

Protocol:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**1.** Trypsinize cells and transfer to a 15 mL conical tube. Count the cells to determine concentration
  
 **2.** Save some cells to continue propogation (1-2 mL), then spin down at 200xg for 5 minutes

 **3.** Dilute to 2e5 cells/mL in PBS.

 **4.** Filter the cells by priming the filter with culture media, then adding the cell-PBS mixture to filter through into a new tube.

  **5.** Add 15 µL of the strained cell suspension to the DispensMe tube 

  **6.** Use a wide bone 200 µL pipette tip to pipette up and down 30 times, ensuring cells are evenly distributed in the viscous solution. Ensure there are no bubbles. 

  **7.** Place the tube without a cap into the first positon on the machine (closest to the little wash tub)
