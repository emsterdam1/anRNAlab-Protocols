Double Restriction Enzyme Plasmid Sub-Cloning
================================================================================
This is a general protocol for how to digest an existing plasmid, and re-ligate with 
an insert. Check out the Lab Benchling for the Plasmid Database (https://benchling.com/bowbritt/f_/8mJrYOJH-plasmid-database/) 
and pTETRIS Expression vectors (https://benchling.com/cweidmann/f_/7cICZyyi-ptetris-expression-vectors/) for possible backbones.

Protocol:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Amplification and Digestion of Insert (~1.5 hrs)** 

**1.** Prepare a 25 uL Q5 PCR reaction to append the restriction enzyme (RE) sites to the ends of your DNA of interest, and run for 25-30 cycles.

 **2.** Use the PCR Clean-up kit or SPRI beads (adjust ratio based on product size) to purify the resulting product.

 **3.** Validate the expected product size by gel or TapeStation.

 **4.** Set up a restriction enzyme digest for the insert. Be sure to know your insert length. <br/> 
 _Note: a Unit is defined as enzyme required to cut 1 µg single site plasmid (~3kb) in 1 hour._ <br/>
 _You will want 3000/insert length*5 units to ensure complete digestion per µg insert in 1 hour._
| Component | Concentration | Quantity | 
  | ---------: | ---------: | :---------- |
  | DNA | 250-500 ng | **X**  µL | 
  | NEB rCutSmart Buffer | 10X | 2.5  µL |
  | Restriction Enzyme (s) |Usually 20 U/uL| **Y**  µL |
  | Nuclease Free Water || Up to 25  µL |
  || **Total** | 25 µL |
 
 *The DNA input does not necessarily have to be ~500 ng; could be scaled up or down*
 
 *Y: Total restriction enzyme added should not exceed 10 % of the total volume.*

 **5.** Run the RE digest at 37°C for an hour (Check to see if your RE has different conditions), and heat inactivate as necessary.

 **6.** Clean up the insert with PCR Clean-Up or SPRI beads. Measure concentration with a spectrophotometer.

<br/><br/><br/><br/>

**Digesting and Purifying Plasmid Backbone (~2.5hrs)**

**1.** Set up a restriction enzyme (RE) digest of the plasmid backbone. If you need a large amount of backbone for multiple ligation reactions, set up multiple digestions. Since multiple REs will be used, it is STRONGLY encouraged to have single and no RE control samples, to ensure the REs are functional. Be sure to know the length of your plasmid.
| Component | Concentration | Quantity | 
  | ---------: | ---------: | :---------- |
  | DNA | 1 µg  | **X**  µL | 
  | NEB rCutSmart Buffer | 10X | 1  µL |
  | Restriction Enzyme (s) |Usually, 20 U/uL| **Y**  µL |
  | Nuclease Free Water || Up to 10  µL |
  || **Total** | 10 µL |
  
*The DNA input does not necessarily have to be ~500 ng; could be scaled up or down*

 **2.** Run the RE digest at 37°C for an hour (Check to see if your RE has different conditions). Heat inactivate *only* if the only item you need is the plasmid backbone.

 **3.** While this is running, pour a 1% agarose gel with the smallest combs (12 wells) for downstream gel purification of the backbones.

 _Dephosphorylate 5′ ends of the plasmid (CIP) to prevent sealing without an insert during ligation._ <br/> _Unless you plan on using a cut out insert to subclone, you can add CIP directly after digestion._

 **4.** Add 1 µL of Quick CIP to the RE reaction, and incubate for another 10 min at 37°C. 

 **5.** Heat inactivate 80°C for 2 minutes. This should inactivate the CIP and the REs.

 _If the insert is being isolated for ligation later, do not CIP the digestion reaction!_

 **6.** Run your multi-, single, and undigested digested plasmid on the gel. 90V for an hour should be sufficient.

 **7.** Cut out the plasmid backbone (and insert, if applicable), minimizing light exposure. <br/>
 Gel purify the slices via Monarch NEB Gel Purification Spin Kit. <br/>
 Multiple slices/melts can be pooled into one column (up to 5 µg). Elute into 20 µl and measure concentration.

**Optional CIP Reaction (~0.5hrs)**

_When cloning with an insert cut from plasmid, dephosphorylate the backbone separately._ 

**1.** Setup the following reaction with the *digested plasmid backbone*.
| Component | Concentration | Quantity | 
  | ---------: | ---------: | :---------- |
  | Plasmid Backbone | variable  | 17  µL | 
  | NEB rCutSmart Buffer | 10X | 2  µL |
  | Quick CIP || 1  µL |
  | Nuclease Free Water || Up to 20 µL **Total**|

*Technically, CIP acts on 1 pmol of DNA ends, but 1 µL is usually enough; adjust if needed*

**2.** Heat for 10 min at 37°C, then heat inactivate for 2 minutes at 80°C

**3.** PCR Clean-Up the backbone

**Ligation Reaction (30 min + overnight)**
  
  **1.** Thaw 10X Ligase Buffer at room temperature, frequently pipette mixing until resuspended.

  **2.** Prepare the following ligation reaction. <br/> _Include no ligase and no insert controls_

https://nebiocalculator.neb.com/#!/ligation
  
| Component | Concentration | Quantity | 
  | ---------: | ---------: | :---------- |
  | Plasmid Backbone | variable  | ~50-100 ng |
  | Insert | variable  | 3 molar equivalents of backbone | 
  | T4 Ligase Buffer | 10X | 2  µL |
  | Ligase || 1  µL |
  | Nuclease Free Water || Up to 20 µL **Total**|

  *Formally, it should be 0.02pmol of backbone to 0.06 pmol of insert, but the ratio is more important. Use the NEB Ligation calculator to calculate molar equivelnt*

  **3.** Incubate overnight at 16°C, then heat inactivate the next day for 20 minutes at 65°C.
