Protocol:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Part 1: Kinase probes and prepare beads (1.5 hours)**

**1.** Assemble a kinase reaction for each capture sample.<br/>
_Note: Be sure to include samples for capture with U1 control probes._

  | Component | Concentration | Quantity | 
  | ---------: | ---------: | :---------- |
  | probes | 100 µM | **10**  µL | 
  | RNase-free water | | **5.5**  µL |
  | T4 Ligase Buffer | 10X | **2**  µL |
  | T4 PNK  | 10 U/µl | **2**  µL |  
  || **Total** | **20** µL |
  
**2.** Incubate the reaction for 1 hour at 37 °C.<br/>
While samples are kinased, prepare buffers for bead equilibration:<br/>
Per capture: 600 µl of dT Wash Buffer, 100 µl of dT Binding Buffer

**3.** During kinase incubation, prepare Oligo d(T)<sub>25</sub> magnetic beads:<br/>
Aliquot 50 µl bead slurry per capture. Capture beads and remove liquid.

**4.** Wash beads twice (suspending beads each time) in 50 µl dT Wash Buffer.

**5.** Resuspend beads in 25 µl of dT Binding Buffer. Add 1 µl of 1 mM polyA splint.

**6.** Incubate at 25 °C with 1000 rpm shaking for 30 minutes.

**7.** Wash beads three times with 50 µl dT Wash Buffer.<br/>
_Don't remove the last wash until the PNK reaction is finished._

<br/>

**Part 2: Splinted ligation of probes to beads (1 hour)**

**8.** Prepare 25 µl of 2X Quick Ligation Mix per capture.

**9.** Resuspend beads in 20 µl of PNK reaction and 20 µl of 2X Quick Ligation Mix.

**10.** Incubate at 25 °C with 1250 rpm shaking for 30 minutes.<br/>
While beads are ligated, prepare buffers for bead equilibration:<br/>
Per capture: 400 µl of TE Elution, 600 µl of 4M Urea Hyb, 200 µl SDS Wash

**11.** Wash beads three times with 50 µl dT Wash Buffer:<br/>
each wash should be 2 min at 95 °C with 1250 rpm shaking.

**12.** Wash beads three times (quick at RT) with 50 µl 4M Urea Hyb.

**13.** Resuspend beads in 25 µl of 4M Urea Hyb Buffer.

<br/>

**Part 3: RNA Capture (1.5 hours for single capture/3 hours for double capture)**

**14.** Mix 10 µg of RNA into 200 µl of 4M Urea Hyb Buffer and pre-warm to 42 °C.

**15.** Add RNA mix to 25 µl of ligated beads.<br/>
_Note: If performing a double capture, use 12.5 µl beads for each sequential capture._

**16.** Hybridize to beads at 42 °C for 30 minutes with 1000 rpm shaking.<br/>
_In theory, flowthrough could be added to other probe-beads to capture other targets._

**17.** Perform the following washes to bound beads:<br/>
2X 50 µl washes with **4M Urea Hyb**, 2 minutes at 37 °C with 1100 rpm shaking  
2X 50 µl washes with **SDS Wash**, 2 minutes at 37 °C with 1100 rpm shaking  
2X 50 µl washes with **dT Wash**, 2 minutes at 37 °C with 1100 rpm shaking  
2X 50 µl washes with **TE Elution**, quick washes at RT

**18.** Resuspend beads in 15 µl TE Elution,<br/>
Heat 3 minutes at 95 °C with 1350 rpm shaking.<br/>
Retain first elution, repeat 15 µl elution with beads,<br/>
combine first and second elution for a total of 30 µl.<br/>
_Note: If performing double capture, take elution to step 14 and repeat._

<br/>

**Part 4: qPCR validation (2.5 hours)**

**19.** Perform qPCR of target on Input RNA and elution to confirm enrichment.
