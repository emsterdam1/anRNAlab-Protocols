SPRI beads for nucleic acid cleanup or concentration and DNA size selection
================================================================================
Description: Solid Phase Reversible Immobilisation (SPRI) beads, along with salt and crowding agent,<br/>
enable unique modes of purifying nucleic acids.

Protocol:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**1.** Allow SPRI beads/crowding solution to reach room temperature. Vortex mixture before use.

**2.** To nucleic acid sample, add 1.8 X volumes of SPRI beads/crowding solution. Mix well and let sit at room temperature for 5 minutes.
  ◦ _Note: Lower volume ratios can be used for [size-selection](http://gc3fstorage.uoregon.edu/IMAGES/Evaluation_of_Omega_Mag-Bind_TotalPure_NGS_Beads_MWeitzman_April2018.pdf) of DNA. This is useful for eliminating PCR primer dimers and truncated products._<br/>
  
  ◦ _If you want to capture 90-200 nt RNAs, use 3X beads + 1.8X isopropanol <br/>  or add 1.2X beads and 1.8X isopropanol (original volumes) to the first flowthrough._<br/>
  
  ◦ _If you want to capture very small RNAs 18 to 65 nt, use 5X beads + 7.2X isopropanol <br/>  or add 1.2X beads and 5.4X isopropanol (X of original volume) to the second flowthrough._
 
**3.** Capture beads on magnetic stand for 2 minutes (until solution clarifies).

**4.** Remove liquid from beads. Add ethanol (70% for larger RNA, 80% for DNA, 85% for smaller RNAs) equal to at least 2 volumes of starting mix.  
  Incubate on magnetic stand for 1 minute at room temperature.  
  ◦ _Note: larger DNA fragments will remain on beads. If selecting for smaller fragments with a moderate ratio, retain the removed starting liquid for a follow-up higher ratio cleanup._

**5.** Remove ethanol and repeat wash (1X for DNA, 2X for RNA). These washes can be removed immediately.

**6.** Remove as much ethanol as possible and air-dry the samples for 5-8 minutes.

**7.** Resuspend samples in desired volume of desired buffer. Capture beads on magnetic stand and recover eluted nucleic acid.  
  ◦ _Note: Some stands won't retain all the beads easily, and you may have to pipette off less than the total to minimize bead carry-over._
